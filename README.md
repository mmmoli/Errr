I have a really bad habit of restarting projects.

It's ususally something to do with the setup.

This repo is my attempt to create a starter project with the basic tools I use ready-to-go.

## Tools included

| Tech/Service      | Opinion      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Bun | Fine (Â no better than pnpm) |
| React-Router | Love it |
| better-auth | New to me (but looks great!) |
| Shadcn/ui + tailwind | Love it |
| [rich-domain](https://github.com/4lessandrodev/rich-domain) | Love it |
| [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/docs) | Love it |
